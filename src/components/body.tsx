      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>👋🏻 I'm Sean, a Software Engineer with a background in startups, charities and product management</p>
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>I've been building B2B and B2C tech products for over 5 years as a non-technical startup founder. In 2023, I moved over to the technical side. <br /><br />

      Previously, I've led Product, UX, User Research, Sales, Marketing, Fundraising, Management and Compliance. So, it's fair to say I'm exceptionally versatile, adaptable and resilient. I'm a proactive problem-solver and I love big challenges.</p>
